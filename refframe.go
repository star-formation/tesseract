    The game world is a hiearchical tree of reference frames.
    Each reference frame except the root has one parent reference frame.
    Child frames are "dragged along" their parent frames.

    Most gameplay logic only knows about the local frame, but some gameplay
    involves multiple frames.  For example, warp drive involves leaving one
    ref frame, spending some time in a noninteractive / locked frame and
    then arriving in a destination frame.

    The top-level or root reference frame is the Milky Way galaxy.
    It has no parent or surrounding context and can be thought of as a
    static/stationary 3D grid.

    2nd level reference frames are generally star systems, centered on the
    system's approximate barycenter.  In a single-star system the reference
    frame center is the center of the star.

    3rd level frames can be planets orbiting stars, 4th level moons of planets.

    The location of a reference frame relative its parent is encoded
    as either a 3D X,Y,Z position or as orbital elements, with the other
    set to nil.

    If the frame is stationary relative its parent - for example the inside
    of a building on a planet surface - then it has a 3D position (X,Y,Z)
    but no orbital elements.
