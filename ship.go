// Ship classes are analogous to classical navy ship classes.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_class.
//
// Each class is uniquely identified by a set of constants defining physical
// and gameplay parameters.
//
// Ship classes are not OOP classes and there is no inheritance or
// instancing.  Rather, each ship class is encoded as a set of constants and
// an empty struct implements the ShipClass interface.
//
// This enables other packages to read immutable ship parameters while
// game state components store dynamic parameters like ship mass and
// hull/armor/shield hit points.
//
// Naming convention: "Base" and "Cap" denotes a value intrinsic
// to the ship class before effects are applied from any attached modules
// or player character skills.  "Base" and "Cap" are always suffixes.
//
// A parameter's real-time value can be lower than its base value.
// An example of this is a ship without any modules or cargo flown by a player
// with trained aerodynamic skills - the ship's effective drag would be lower
// than the hull's base value.

	// The ship volume when packed inside a cargo bay or other storage.

	// Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) Max Torque in newtons (N).
	//
	// This is a built-in, non-modular engine situated at the ship's
	// center of mass.  The CMG has a single function: generate torque around
	// the ship's center of mass.  This rotates the ship in any direction
	// without changing velocity.
	//
	// This is a simple mechanism to enable the physics engine to simulate
	// "turning inertia" realistically; players will notice their ships
	// turn slower when storing heavy cargo or fielding heavy modules
	// like armor plates.
	//
	// By using a 3D vector we can configure ships that turn faster "up"/"down"
	// (pitch) than "left"/"right" (yaw), making banked turns useful
	// even in zero-g/vacuum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn).
